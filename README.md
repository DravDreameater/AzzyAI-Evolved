I am not the original designer, programmer or developer of this AI, I simply wanted to fix a few issues with it after years of updates to the game, and in turn ended up working on it for players of the EU server. I Have no plans to be a long term developer of this, or project manager and claim no rights to any of the work done to it prior to my work on it. 

# AzzyAI

This is the source code repository for AzzyAI. 

I no longer play RO, and do not have time to take it up or maintain this AI except on a paid basis ($50/hr - that's what I get for other paid projects). I would like to find someone else to take up further development and maintenance of this AI - please contact me if you are interested - I can provide a bit of orientation for someone taking this on. 

=== Organization ===

* DEFAULT contains the default AI
* USER_AI contains AzzyAI
* scripts contains scripts used to prepare releases of AzzyAI
* AzzyAIConfig contains the source code for the config tool
